This is the project for "Predicting Diamond Prices" based on their characteristics.

* The dataset contains the following columns:
   * Carat : Weight of the diamond (0.2 - 5.01)
   * Cut : Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
   * Color : Diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)
   * Clarity : A measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
   * Depth : Total depth percentage = 2z/(x+y)
   * Table : Width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43 - 95)
   * x : Length in mm (0 - 10.74)
   * y : Width in mm (0 - 58.9)
   * z : Depth in mm (0 - 31.8)
   * Price : Price in US dollars (\$326 - \$18,823)
   * volume : x * y * z
